\section{Problem 2}

You throw a set of 3 regular dice again and again, until for the first time you see a
sum of 11 or a sum of 16.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] Design an appropriate probability space for the above process.
	\item[2.] What is the probability that you stop because you see a sum of 16?
\end{itemize}
