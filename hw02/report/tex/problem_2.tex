\section{Problem 2}

Assume that a graph is stored in the edge incidence model, that is, all edges incident to one vertex are stored sequentially.\\
Our sampling algorithm for estimating the triangle coefficient relies on sampling one connected triple of the graph with uniform probability. Namely, all connected triples should have equal probability to be sampled. Describe a three-pass algorithm to sample a connected triple uniformly at random.\\
\textbf{Note:} This is already outlined in the slides, you are asked to describe the method in more detail.
